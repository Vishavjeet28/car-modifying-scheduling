# Multiple Appointments Per User Feature

## Overview
Updated the CarModX appointment system to allow unlimited appointments per user, removing previous restrictions that limited customers to one appointment per date.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Model Changes
**File: `appointments/models.py`**
- **Removed**: `unique_together = ['customer', 'slot_date']` constraint
- **Updated**: Meta class to allow multiple appointments per customer
- **Migration**: Created `0004_alter_appointment_unique_together.py` to remove database constraint

**Before:**
```python
class Meta:
    ordering = ['-created_at']
    unique_together = ['customer', 'slot_date']  # REMOVED
```

**After:**
```python
class Meta:
    ordering = ['-created_at']
    # Allow multiple appointments per customer (no unique constraints)
```

### 2. Form Validation Changes
**File: `appointments/forms.py`**
- **Removed**: Customer duplicate appointment validation in `clean()` method
- **Kept**: Daily capacity limits (5 appointments per day total)
- **Kept**: Time slot occupation checks

**Before:**
```python
# Check if customer already has appointment on this date
if self.user and Appointment.objects.filter(
    customer=self.user,
    slot_date=slot_date,
    status__in=['booked', 'assigned', 'in_progress', 'on_hold']
).exists():
    raise ValidationError("You already have an active appointment for this date.")
```

**After:** *(Removed this validation entirely)*

### 3. Enhanced Booking Page
**File: `templates/appointments/book_appointment.html`**
- **Added**: 7-day availability overview when page loads
- **Enhanced**: Real-time slot availability display
- **Improved**: Visual feedback for slot occupancy across multiple dates

## Current System Behavior

### âœ… What's Allowed
1. **Unlimited appointments per user** - No restrictions on how many appointments one person can book
2. **Multiple appointments per date** - Users can book multiple time slots on the same day
3. **Multiple appointments across dates** - Users can book appointments on different dates
4. **Flexible scheduling** - Complete freedom for customers to book as needed

### ðŸš« What's Still Restricted
1. **Daily capacity limit** - Maximum 5 appointments per day (across all customers)
2. **Time slot conflicts** - Cannot double-book the same time slot
3. **Past date bookings** - Cannot book appointments for past dates
4. **Future date limit** - Cannot book more than 30 days in advance

## Testing Results

### âœ… Core Functionality Tests
- âœ… User can book multiple appointments on different dates
- âœ… User can book multiple appointments on same date (different time slots)
- âœ… Web form allows multiple bookings without restrictions
- âœ… Daily capacity limits still enforced (5 per day max)
- âœ… Time slot conflicts prevented
- âœ… Enhanced booking page shows 7-day availability overview

### ðŸ“Š Test Scenarios Completed
1. **Multiple Date Bookings**: User booked 3 appointments on consecutive days
2. **Same Date Multiple Slots**: User booked 2 appointments on same date
3. **Web Form Integration**: Successfully booked via web interface
4. **Capacity Enforcement**: System properly rejects 6th daily appointment
5. **Time Slot Management**: Prevents double-booking of specific time slots

## Example User Journey

A customer can now:
1. **Visit booking page** â†’ See 7-day availability overview immediately
2. **Book morning service** â†’ Schedule 9:00 AM appointment for car modification
3. **Book afternoon service** â†’ Schedule 3:00 PM appointment same day for different service
4. **Book next day** â†’ Schedule appointment for following day
5. **View all appointments** â†’ See complete schedule in their account

## Database Migration

**Migration File**: `appointments/migrations/0004_alter_appointment_unique_together.py`
```python
operations = [
    migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(
        name='appointment',
        unique_together=set(),  # Removes all unique constraints
    ),
]
```
