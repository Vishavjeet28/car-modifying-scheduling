# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive admin management interface that allows super users to have full control over services, employees, pricing, and system data. The interface will be separate from the standard Django admin and provide a user-friendly, custom dashboard for business operations management.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a super user, I want to manage dynamic pricing for services, so that I can set different prices based on vehicle types and complexity levels.

2. WHEN a super user adds a price variant THEN the system SHALL require vehicle type, complexity level, and price
3. WHEN a super user sets multiple prices for the same service THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate combinations
